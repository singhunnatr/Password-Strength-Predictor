Project Name: Password Strength Predictor

Description:
This project aims to predict the strength of passwords entered by users using a machine learning model. It utilizes a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset containing various password features such as the presence of digits, special symbols, and length. The model predicts whether a password is weak, medium, or strong based on these features.

Usage:
1. Training the Model:
   - Before using the prediction functionality, it's necessary to train the model. The provided script `training.py` performs the training process. Ensure that the dataset `password_dataset.csv` is present in the same directory as the script. Run the script to train the model, which will be saved as `password_strength_model.pkl`.

2. Predicting Password Strength:
   - Once the model is trained, users can predict the strength of passwords using the script `Password_Strength_Predictor.py`. Simply run the script, and it will prompt you to input a password. After inputting the password, it will predict its strength and display the result.

Future Developments:
1. Integration with Password Leak Databases:
   - Implement functionality to check if a password has been leaked in any known data breaches. This feature will enhance security by warning users if their password has been compromised.

File Structure:
- `training.py`: Script to train the Random Forest model on password dataset.
- `Password_Strength_Predictor.py`: Script to predict password strength based on user input.
- `password_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing passwords and their corresponding strengths.
- `password_strength_model.pkl`: Trained model saved as a binary file.
- `README.md`: Documentation file containing instructions and information about the project.
